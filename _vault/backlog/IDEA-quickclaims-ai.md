# QuickClaims.ai

## Problem Statement
Roofers and insurance supplemental companies spend hours each day processing the same exact kinds of documents, identifying the same line items, sending the same emails, all to achieve a just payout from the insurance company that was left out of the initial claim summary sent by the insurance adjuster. This is an A-Z streamlined insurance claim supplement process problem.

## Proposed Solution
- Drag and drop project funnel for the initial insurance claim summary/estimate
- Based on over 1,000+ real world insurance claims documents, and SOPs supplement estimators are required to follow each time they receive a new scope, our document parser/AI assistant can create the entire project, identify all missing line items, quantities based on relation to the scope and measurements, and priced based on Xactimate's most recent price sheet
- Supplement estimator, roofing contractor, home owner all get almost immediate feedback and plans to move forward swiftly
- Supplement adjustment teams goes from 30 estimators to 20, while increasing total claims processed
- Supplement estimators never miss a follow up
- Implement voice-to-voice agents to work as liaisons between the insurance claims supplement estimate and the other party
- Supplement estimator never creates a single doc, and only has to approve emails the AI agent is solving

## Initial Signals
- **Searched for solutions?** Yes - Rise Roofing Supplements and Service Titan exist but lack real AI automation
- **Would you pay for this?** Yes - $99-299/mo per user, high value for time saved

- Xactimate price sheets are the industry standard for pricing
- Voice agents could handle follow-up calls and liaison work
